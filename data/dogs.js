He would love a Dachshund experienced home that can set him up for success! He is looking for a confident handler that will set boundaries and provide him with training and love. Rudy can be a little bossy on leash with other dogs,but can get along with some after meeting. Passive female dogs are recommended. We are unsure about his history with cats. Rudy would be best suited for a home with teens and adults that can participate in his care and training. Volunteer Leah had this to say about Rudy \"He is full of spunk and personality! He is a fun dog, who is active and engaging and is sure to bring a smile to your face with all of his antics.\" Rudy enjoys walks and play time, and he is hoping you'll stop by and visit him today.

Homer enjoys running, playing, and would like to lead an active lifestyle with a home that can provide him daily exercise. Homer gets along well with other dogs but may be a bit overwhelming for very small ones. He does need to learn some manners around cats as he does like to chase playfully. Homer is big, boisterous, and exuberant and due to his rough and tumble play style and large size would be best suited for a home with teens and adults that have previous large breed dog experience. Homer would likely do best in a home with access to a yard and would not be a good candidate for apartment or condo living. Homer will make a great exercise partner and friend!\n",
